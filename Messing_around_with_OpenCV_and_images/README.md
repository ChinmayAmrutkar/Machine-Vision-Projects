# OpenCV and Image Processing Exploration

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to experimenting with OpenCV and image processing techniques. The main objective is to explore image manipulation, including displaying, cropping, resizing, and analyzing image transformations using different interpolation methods. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of image processing while experimenting with OpenCV functions.

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Displaying an Image
- Load an image using OpenCV.
- Use Matplotlib (`plt.imshow`, `plt.show`) to display the image.
- Correct color inversion using `cv2.cvtColor`.

### 2. Zooming into an Image
- Crop a specific portion of the image.
- Analyze the cropped section, observing textures, colors, and patterns.

### 3. Image Downsampling
- Load another image for sampling.
- Reduce its size by a factor of 10 in width and height using `cv2.resize`.
- Display the downsampled image.

### 4. Image Upsampling
- Upscale the downsampled image back to its original size using two different interpolation methods:
  - Nearest Neighbor
  - Bicubic
- Display the upsampled images.

### 5. Error Analysis in Upsampling
- Compute the absolute difference between the original and upsampled images.
- Save the difference images for both interpolation methods.
- Sum all pixel differences and compare error values.
- Discuss use cases where one interpolation method might be preferable over another.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more advanced image processing techniques.
- Explore additional OpenCV functionalities such as edge detection, filtering, and object recognition.
- Implement automation for analyzing multiple images.

Stay tuned for updates as more experiments and results are added!
