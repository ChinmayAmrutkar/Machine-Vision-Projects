# Machine Vision Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Vision Projects** repository! This repository is dedicated to my exploration and learning in the field of **Machine Vision** using popular libraries like **OpenCV** and other tools. Here, you'll find various projects where I experiment with different techniques such as **image processing, feature extraction, object detection, and path planning**.

## Projects

- **First Project:** Messing around with OpenCV and Images
- **Future Projects:** *(In Progress)*

Feel free to explore the projects and contribute to any of them. Each project will have its own folder with a **detailed explanation, code, and sometimes additional resources or data**.

---

## Tools & Libraries

- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Python**

---

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, you'll need to have **Python installed** along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

---

## Prerequisites and Setup Instructions

We will utilize the **Python programming language** along with **OpenCV bindings** to do most of the image processing required in the homework assignments. In addition, we will utilize several **helper libraries** for visualizing images and displaying output.

### 1. Install Anaconda Python

- Follow the instructions specific to your operating system: **[Anaconda Python Installation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)**.
- You can use either the **graphical installer** or the **command line version**.
- **Test your installation:**
  - Create a file called `helloworld.py` and add the following code:
    ```python
    print('Hello World!')
    ```
  - Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python helloworld.py
    ```
  - You should see the output: **Hello World!**. If you encounter any errors, double-check your Anaconda installation (**Google and Stack Overflow are your friends!**).

### 2. Install OpenCV via Anaconda

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

If this command does not work, try searching for how to install OpenCV for your specific Anaconda distribution or operating system.

### 3. Install Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a useful library for visualizing graphical output. Install it by running:

```bash
conda install matplotlib
```

### 4. Verify Library Installation

Create a file named `testimport.py` with the following lines:

```python
import cv2
import matplotlib
import ipdb
```

Run the file. If there are no errors, then all required libraries have been installed successfully.

### 5. IDE Recommendation

For prototyping your code, I recommend using an **IDE** such as:

- **[VS Code]**(https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- **[Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)** (included with Anaconda)
- **[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)**

If you run into any issues during setup, remember that a **quick Google search** (e.g., *"How do I install [package] on [OS]?"*) is often very helpful.
